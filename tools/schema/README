The files in this directory list tokens in the Kythe schema in
priority order. For example, if you had to come up with
`ref/call/direct/implicit`, observe that `ref` is listed first;
then `call`; then `direct`; and finally `implicit`. Not all
combinations of tokens make sense, but canonicalizing their
order helps with some optimizations.
