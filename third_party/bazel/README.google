Description: Correct, reproducible, and fast builds for everyone.

Modifications:
* Only the needed subset of bazel protos have been imported.
* Added necessary license declarations to BUILD files.
* The extra_actions_base and test_status protos have their generated Go source code checked-in.

Two helper scripts (get_devdir.sh and get_sdkroot.sh) were created by
modifying src/tools/xcode/xcrunwrapper/xcrunwrapper.sh @
180d1b56b8aea8fab974cfa57e9182598990710c.
