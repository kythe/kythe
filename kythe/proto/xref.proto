// Design document: <link when written>
// This proto represents a very preliminary attempt to define a cross-reference
// service interface, based on Kythe data.
//
// Tickets are Kythe URIs (http://www.kythe.io/docs/kythe-uri-spec.html).

// XRefService provides access to a Kythe graph for fast read-only access to
// cross-reference relationships.  What constitutes a "Cross-reference" is not
// precisely defined, but generally includes non-transitive (single-step)
// relation like usage of a declaration, instantiation of a type, invocation of
// a function, direct inheritance or overrides, and so forth.  Some transitive
// relations can be converted into cross-references by precomputing a flattened
// representation of a transitive relation.  In general, though, this service
// is designed to be most efficient for single-step expansions.
//
// Key design principles:
//  - All requests must be satisfied "quickly", e.g., in time proportional to
//    the size of the returned set.
//
//  - The client should be able to batch related requests.
//
//  - The client specifies exactly what facts should be returned.
//
// There is no distinction made in the API between "node not found" and "no
// facts/edges for node".  A node is extensionally defined by its facts and
// edges, so a node without any facts or edges is not considered to exist.
service XRefService {

  // TODO(schroederc): break off Nodes/Edges into a separate service

  // Nodes returns a subset of the facts for each of the requested nodes.
  rpc Nodes(NodesRequest) returns (NodesReply) {}

  // Edges returns a subset of the outbound edges for each of a set of
  // requested nodes.

  // Decorations returns an index of the nodes and edges associated with a
  // particular file node.
  rpc Decorations(DecorationsRequest) returns (DecorationsReply) {}

  // CrossReferences returns the global references, definitions, and
  // documentation of a set of requested nodes.
  rpc CrossReferences(CrossReferencesRequest) returns (CrossReferencesReply) {}

  // Callers takes a set of tickets for semantic objects and returns the set
  // of places where those objects were called. For example, in the program
  //   void bar() { foo(); foo(); } void baz() { foo(); } void foo() { }
  // `Callers({foo})` would return:
  //   {(bar, {first-call-anchor, second-call-anchor}),
  //    (baz, {first-call-anchor})}
  // To walk further up the call graph, you can project the first field of
  // each tuple in the result set ({bar, baz}) and feed that set back in
  // to a new Callers request.
