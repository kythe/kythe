// Rules:
//  - All fields must be optional, and must have default values.
//  - No field may ever be removed.  If a field is deprecated, it may be
//    renamed or marked with a comment, but must not be deleted.
//  - New fields are always added to the end of the message.
//  - All fields must be strings, not messages.
//
// One of the key principles is that we want as few fields as possible in a
// vname.  We're not trying to exhaust the possible dimensions along which a
// name could vary, but to find a minimal basis. Be conservative.

  //
  // However, this need not be a true file path; virtual objects like figments
  // can assign an ad-hoc abstract ID, or omit it entirely.

  // is not a good axis for a name -- a name should say "what" something is, not
  // "when".  So we will store timestamps, revisions, and other markers of this
