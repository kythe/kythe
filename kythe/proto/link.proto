// A LinkService resolves "links" based on qualified names.  Given a qualified
// name, resolution consists of finding the entities that define that name and
// returning the locations of their definition sites. This permits a client to
// record a durable reference to an object whose definition may move within a
// source file or even across source files over time.
//
// Because the mapping between qualified names and definitions is not unique in
// general, the service permits the client to specify various constraints on a
// query. The client records the effective constraints along with the qualified
// name, e.g., as query parameters.
//
// Qualified names use the same format and have the same constraints as in the
// IdentifierService defined by identifier.proto. This concurrence is intended,
// so that a link service can be implemented using the same underlying data.
