// This file defines a graph service interface, based on Kythe data.
//
// Tickets are Kythe URIs (http://www.kythe.io/docs/kythe-uri-spec.html).

// GraphService provides fast single-step node and edge lookups in a Kythe
// graph. The difference between this and a GraphStore is that queries for
// reverse relationships are also expected to be fast.
//
// There is no distinction between "node not found" and "no facts/edges for
// node".  A node is extensionally defined by its facts and edges, so a node
// without any facts or edges is not considered to exist.

  // requested, the server will return an error.
  //
  // If page_size > 0, at most that number of edges will be returned by the
  // service for this request (see EdgeSet and EdgesReply below).
  // If page_size = 0, the default, the server will assume a reasonable default
  // page size.  The server will return an error if page_size < 0.
