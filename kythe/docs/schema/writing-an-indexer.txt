Writing a New Indexer
=====================
:Revision: 1.0
:toc2:
:toclevels: 3
:priority: 999

This document is an overview of the steps to take to add support for a new
language to Kythe. We assume that you have the
link:https://github.com/kythe/kythe/releases[Kythe release package] extracted
to `/opt/kythe`. You can also build the tools from source (but it is not
necessary to build Kythe to provide it with graph data). Sample code snippets
are written in JavaScript, but this document is not about indexing any
particular language.

In the Kythe pipeline, a language's *indexer* is responsible for building a
subgraph that represents a particular program. Complete indexers usually accept
link:https://www.kythe.io/docs/kythe-kzip.html[`.kzip`] files that contain a
program, all of its dependencies, and the arguments necessary for a compiler or
interpreter to understand it. This data is packaged by a separate component
called an *extractor*. Depending on the language and build system involved, it
may be possible to use a generic extractor to produce these hermetic
compilation units. We will not address extraction here.

For development and testing, it's useful for the indexer to accept program text
directly as input; this is how we will proceed in these instructions. First,
we'll begin by writing some scripts to insert file content into a small Kythe
graph. From there, we'll see how to encode Kythe nodes and edges into *entries*,
the unit of exchange between many of our tools. We'll see that certain kinds
of nodes are used to represent common sorts of semantic objects in programming
languages and that other nodes are used to represent syntactic spans of text.
We will add relationships as edges between these nodes to add cross-reference
data to the graph. This allows users to jump between definitions and references
in programs we've indexed. Finally, we'll discuss how to write tests for (and
how to debug) Kythe indexers.

== Bootstrapping Kythe support

Kythe indexers emit directed graph data as a stream of *entries* that can
represent either nodes or edges. These have various encodings, but for
simplicity we'll use JSON. To get started, let's write a script `kythe-browse.sh`
that will turn a stream of JSON-formatted Kythe entries into a format that our
example code browser can read. Put it in your Kythe root; it will clobber the
directories `//graphstore` and `//tables`.

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash -e
set -o pipefail
BROWSE_PORT="${BROWSE_PORT:-8080}"
# You can find prebuilt binaries at https://github.com/kythe/kythe/releases.
# This script assumes that they are installed to /opt/kythe.
# If you build the tools yourself or install them to a different location,
# make sure to pass the correct public_resources directory to http_server.
rm -f -- graphstore/* tables/*
mkdir -p graphstore tables
# Read JSON entries from standard in to a graphstore.
/opt/kythe/tools/entrystream --read_json \
  | /opt/kythe/tools/write_entries -graphstore graphstore
# Convert the graphstore to serving tables.
/opt/kythe/tools/write_tables -graphstore graphstore -out=tables
# Host the browser UI.
/opt/kythe/tools/http_server -serving_table tables \
  -public_resources="/opt/kythe/web/ui" \
  -listen="localhost:${BROWSE_PORT}"
----

TIP: The
link:https://github.com/kythe/kythe/blob/master/kythe/proto/storage.proto[protocol buffer]
encoding of Kythe facts is more efficient than the JSON encoding we're using
here. Kythe supports JSON because some languages do not have good support for
protocol buffers. This only comes into play for languages that emit a large
amount of data, like $$C++$$. The `entrystream` tool used in `kythe-browse.sh`
is invoked to read a stream of JSON entries from standard input and emit a
`varint32`-delimited stream of `kythe.proto.Entry` messages on standard output.

You can test this with a very short entry stream. The only tricky part here is
that Kythe fact values, when serialized to JSON, are base64-encoded. This
ensures that they can be properly deserialized later, since fact values may
contain arbitrary binary data, but JSON strings permit only UTF-8 characters.
`ZmlsZQ==` is `file` and `SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ==` is `Hello, world!`.

[source,bash]
----
echo '
{"source":{"corpus":"example","path":"hello"},
 "fact_name":"/kythe/node/kind","fact_value":"ZmlsZQ=="}
{"source":{"corpus":"example","path":"hello"},
 "fact_name":"/kythe/text","fact_value":"SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ=="}
' | ./kythe-browse.sh
----

You can check that http://localhost:8080/#hello?corpus=example shows
`Hello, world!'.

== Modeling Kythe entries

A Kythe graph can be encoded using two basic data types. The first, called a
http://www.kythe.io/docs/kythe-storage.html#_a_id_termvname_a_vector_name_strong_vname_strong[VName],
uniquely picks out a node in the graph. VNames have five string-valued fields.
http://www.kythe.io/docs/kythe-storage.html#_entry[Entries]
record both facts about individual nodes and edges between them. As described in
the documentation, we only need to emit the forward versions of edges (those
that are described in the http://www.kythe.io/docs/schema[schema]); the Kythe
pipeline takes care of generating reverse edges as needed for efficiency.

We'll encode VNames and entries in a straightforward way; in particular, we
represent entries as objects, where the target's presence or absence determines
if the entry represents an edge between nodes or a fact about a single node
(respectively). Our `fact` and `edge` convenience functions also assume that all
of the fact and edge names we'll use are underneath the `/kythe` prefix, since
we're following the Kythe schema. This prefix is a requirement of the schema,
not of the data model.

[source,js]
----
function vname(signature, path, language, root, corpus) {
  return {
    signature: signature,
    path: path,
    language: language,
    root: root,
    corpus: corpus,
  };
}
function fact(node, fact_name, fact_val) {
  return {
    source: node,
    fact_name: "/kythe/" + fact_name,
    fact_value: base64enc(fact_val),
  };
}
function edge(source, edge_name, target) {
  return {
    source: source,
    edge_kind: "/kythe/edge/" + edge_name,
    target: target,
    fact_name: "/",
  };
}
function ordinal_edge(source, edge_name, target, ordinal) {
  return {
    source: source,
    edge_kind: "/kythe/edge/" + edge_name + "." + ordinal,
    target: target,
    fact_name: "/",
  };
}
----

You can follow along at home with link:https://nodejs.org[node.js] and the
following definitions:

[source,js]
----
function base64enc(string) {
  return new Buffer(string).toString('base64');
}
function emitEntries(entries) {
  entries.forEach(function(v){console.log(JSON.stringify(v))});
}
----

With this representation, our example database becomes:

[source,js]
----
[
  fact(vname("", "hello", "", "", "example"), "node/kind", "file"),
  fact(vname("", "hello", "", "", "example"), "text", "Hello, world!")
]
----

VNames have an alternate
link:http://www.kythe.io/docs/kythe-uri-spec.html[URI-style encoding]. VNames
encoded in this way are called *tickets*; tickets and VNames are semantically
interchangeable. This encoding is used where it is inconvenient or not possible
to store VNames in a more structured format. You can use Kythe URIs when
interacting with the
link:http://www.kythe.io/docs/kythes-command-line-tool.html[Kythe command-line tool]:

[source,bash]
----
/opt/kythe/tools/kythe -api './tables' nodes 'kythe://example?path=hello'
----

.Output
----
kythe://example?path=hello
  /kythe/node/kind	file
  /kythe/text	Hello, world!
----

`kythe://example?path=hello` is the URI encoding of the VName used in the
example graph above.

== File content

Kythe stores file content in its graph. The `http_server` binary used in our
`kythe-browse.sh` script doesn't look in your filesystem for a file to present
to the Web browser; it instead reads the `text` fact off of a graph node.

Since every node in the graph has a VName, we'll need to be able to build one
for any source file your indexer might refer to. In our small example above,
our test file had the path `hello` in the corpus `example`. It is up to you
how to determine the corpus (and possibly root) to which a node belongs. It is
best to keep this configurable; other Kythe indexers use a `vnames.json` file
to choose the VName fields based on regular expressions over paths.

All Kythe graph nodes should have a `node/kind` fact. For files, this kind is
`file`. This means that each file should have at least two associated facts.
You can see the JSON representation of the resulting entries above, where we
used them to test the `kythe-browse.sh` script.

NOTE: The Kythe JSON representation requires fact values to be base64-encoded.
The protocol buffer representation does not, but it does store fact values as
`bytes` instead of the `string` type. The protocol buffer `string` type must be
valid UTF-8 and not all files in a graph may be UTF-8 encoded (though it is the
default). Alternate encodings may be specified using the `encoding` fact.

== Cross-references

Imagine we have the following simple program:

[source,lua]
----
var foo = 1
print foo
----

We want to record the relationship between the reference to `foo` on the second
line and its definition on the first line. First, we should build a
representation for the variable `foo` itself. To summon a node into existence,
we need a VName and a node kind. The schema already defines a node kind
for http://www.kythe.io/docs/schema#variable[variables]. If there is no existing
way to model `foo` in the schema, you're free to invent one of your own; the
schema is intended to be open-ended. Be aware that tools that consume Kythe data
may not be able to offer as much help with custom kinds, but should always be
tolerant of them.

We've already seen that VNames for http://www.kythe.io/docs/schema#file[files]
contain *path*, *root*, and *corpus* components. (In fact, the schema requires
that the other components of a file VName be empty.) We need to come up with
assignments to these, plus *signature* and *language*, that uniquely refer to
our variable `foo`. Getting this right can be subtle. Here are some guidelines:

* Indexing the same compilation unit twice should always produce the same data.
* VNames for objects that are accessible from multiple compilation units must
be generated consistently. For example, if a module defines a public variable
`Bar`, then `Bar`'s VName must be the same in all of the modules that use it.
* VNames should not be over-specific. For example, if your language has a
builtin `string` type, you should only have a single `VName` for that type
(which is probably of the http://www.kythe.io/docs/schema#tbuiltin[tbuiltin]
kind). Structural types should also have single representations; if your
language also has a builtin pair type, there should only be a single `VName`
for `pair<string,string>` (that's probably a
http://www.kythe.io/docs/schema#tapp[tapp]).
* Where possible, VNames should be generated without reference to source
locations. This makes debugging your indexer easier and decreases the number
of spurious changes to the graph when source text is modified.
* Take caution that your *signature* fields aren't too long. In the $$C++$$
indexer, signatures that are past a certain length are replaced with their
hashes. This has significant implications for the size of your graph and the
I/O cost of your tools.
* The *language* component of a VName should be set to a well-known value.
Java is `java`; $$C++$$ is `c++`; and so on. We'll use `ex` as our language.
* Avoid duplicating information that's elsewhere in the VName, like the corpus
label, language label, or path (in cases where a path is appropriate).

We'll use `foo`'s defining file's preset components, the *language* `ex`, and
the *signature* `foo#0` (to mean "the zeroth binding of foo at global scope").
Using the functions we've defined above, we emit the following entry:

[source,js]
----
//         sig      path     lang  root   corpus
fact(vname("foo#0", "hello", "ex", "", "example"), "node/kind", "variable");
----

We can see it in the graph with the `kythe` tool (after running
`kythe-browse.sh` to generate `./tables`):

[source,bash]
----
/opt/kythe/tools/kythe -api './tables' \
    nodes 'kythe://example?path=hello?lang=ex#foo#0'
----

.Output
----
kythe://example?lang=ex?path=hello#foo%230
  /kythe/node/kind	variable
----

Notice how the `#` was URI-encoded in the ticket.

=== Specifying spans of text

Spans of text in Kythe are represented by
http://www.kythe.io/docs/schema#anchor[anchor] nodes. Anchors may overlap.
If an anchor exactly overlaps another anchor (e.g., it shares the same start
and end offsets), it is conventional (but not required) that they share a VName.
Contrary to the general advice for generating VNames, an anchor's VName *should*
be based on its location in a source file.

Besides the required `node/kind` fact, anchors should have `loc/start`
and `loc/end` facts that give their (inclusive) start and (exclusive) end
location offsets as base-10 stringified integers.

NOTE: In Kythe, offsets are always in units of bytes. If your programming
language specifies locations of syntactic objects in lines and columns or
codepoints, you will need to transform these to byte offsets.

[source,js]
----
function anchorVName(file_vname, begin, end) {
  return vname("@" + begin + ":" + end, file_vname.path, "ex", file_vname.root,
      file_vname.corpus);
}
function anchor(file_vname, begin, end) {
  var anchor_vname = anchorVName(file_vname, begin, end);
  return [
    fact(anchor_vname, "node/kind", "anchor"),
    fact(anchor_vname, "loc/start", begin.toString()),
    fact(anchor_vname, "loc/end", end.toString()),
    // This edge is required in the current Kythe release, but it will not be
    // required in a future release.
    edge(anchor_vname, "childof", file_vname)
  ];
}
----

The anchor covering the definition of `foo` in our example file, assuming the
file has the same `VName` as the earlier file, is represented by these three
facts (leaving out the deprecated `childof` edge mentioned in the code):

[source,js]
----
{"source":{"signature":"@4:7","path":"hello","language":"ex","corpus":"example"},
 "edge_name":"/","fact_name":"/kythe/node/kind","fact_value":"YW5jaG9y"}
{"source":{"signature":"@4:7","path":"hello","language":"ex","corpus":"example"},
 "edge_name":"/","fact_name":"/kythe/loc/start","fact_value":"NA=="}
{"source":{"signature":"@4:7","path":"hello","language":"ex","corpus":"example"},
 "edge_name":"/","fact_name":"/kythe/loc/end","fact_value":"Nw=="}
----

=== Linking anchors to semantic nodes

We can now link the definition and reference sites of `foo` back to the node
we created for the variable. To do so, we'll add a
link:http://www.kythe.io/docs/schema/#definesbinding[defines/binding] edge
from the definition site and a link:http://www.kythe.io/docs/schema/#ref[ref]
edge from the use site:

[source,js]
----
edge(foo_def_anchor_vname, "defines/binding", foo_vname),
edge(foo_ref_anchor_vname, "ref", foo_vname)
----

Our full database, specified using the previously-defined functions, looks
like:

[source,js]
----
var hello_file_vname = vname("", "hello", "", "", "example");
var foo_vname = vname("foo#0", "hello", "ex", "", "example");
var foo_def_anchor_vname = anchorVName(hello_file_vname, 4, 7);
var foo_ref_anchor_vname = anchorVName(hello_file_vname, 18, 21);
var entries = [
  fact(hello_file_vname, "node/kind", "file"),
  fact(hello_file_vname, "text", "var foo = 1\nprint foo"),
  fact(foo_vname, "node/kind", "variable"),
  edge(foo_def_anchor_vname, "defines/binding", foo_vname),
  edge(foo_ref_anchor_vname, "ref", foo_vname)
].concat(anchor(hello_file_vname, 4, 7))
 .concat(anchor(hello_file_vname, 18, 21));
----

NOTE: For pedagogical reasons, we're building our graph up as a big array
of entries. In practice, this is a bad idea; graphs can become very large,
and buffering all your data up to release it at the same time prevents
downstream consumers from working in parallel (even if you're just writing
to disk). Indexers should emit graph data as soon as practical (and should also
endeavor to avoid emitting duplicate data).

You can test it using `kythe-browse.sh` and by querying the `kythe` tool for
file decorations:

[source,bash]
----
/opt/kythe/tools/kythe -api './tables' decor 'kythe://example?path=hello'
----

.Output
----
/kythe/edge/defines/binding	1:4-1:7	variable	kythe://example?lang=ex?path=hello#foo%230
/kythe/edge/ref	2:6-2:9	variable	kythe://example?lang=ex?path=hello#foo%230
----

== Testing

Most of the work in testing a tool that produces Kythe data boils down to
checking that different anchors in example source text are linked to the correct
nodes and edges. From this starting point, you can make sure that other parts
of the semantic graph are properly formed.

Given a description of these anchors and their desired relationships,
performing the necessary checks doesn't require any information specific to the
language being analyzed. With this in mind, we built the
http://www.kythe.io/docs/kythe-verifier.html[Kythe verifier]. The verifier
accepts a stream of Kythe entries and source files, the latter of which have
been annotated with *goals*. Each goal describes entries that the verifier must
(or must not) find in its input stream. Since some parts of these entries are
uninteresting to test--for example, the exact encoding used for a anchor's VName
is unimportant--parts of a goal may be replaced with variables for which the
verifier will try to find an assignment.

Just as we were able to drive the Kythe pipeline with only a list of JSON
entries, so too can we drive the verifier with only those entries and a list
of goals. This script, `kythe-verify-json.sh`, reads JSON entries from
standard in and passes them (and its arguments) to the verifier:

[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash -e
set -o pipefail
# You can find prebuilt binaries at https://github.com/kythe/kythe/releases.
# This script assumes that they are installed to /opt/kythe.
# Read JSON entries from standard in and pass them to the verifier.
# The entrystream tool turns the JSON into length-delimited protocol buffers,
# described at http://godoc.org/kythe.io/kythe/go/platform/delimited
/opt/kythe/tools/entrystream --read_format=json | \
/opt/kythe/tools/verifier --nofile_vnames --nocheck_for_singletons "$@"
----

We can write a rule file that checks whether we have any file nodes at all and
call it `test.goals`:

[source,c]
----
//- FileNode.node/kind file
----

The `//-` prefix tells the verifier which lines to look for goals on. It's meant
to be ignored as a comment by most languages. Of course, some languages (like
Python) use different character sequences to denote comments, so it can be
changed with a command-line flag.

We ask the verifier to check that the goals can be met with the entries we wrote
out earlier in this document:

[source,bash]
----
echo '
{"source":{"corpus":"example","path":"hello"},
 "fact_name":"/kythe/node/kind","fact_value":"ZmlsZQ=="}
{"source":{"corpus":"example","path":"hello"},
 "fact_name":"/kythe/text","fact_value":"SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ=="}
' | ./kythe-verify-json.sh test.goals
----

Since we do have a node with kind `file`, the verifier exits with a zero error
code without printing any diagnostics.

If we had written an unsatisfiable goal--let's say we made a spelling mistake
and asked for a node with kind `elif` instead:

[source,c]
----
//- FileNode.node/kind elif
----

the verifier will protest (and return a nonzero exit code):

.Output
----
Could not verify all goals. The furthest we reached was:
  test.goals:2:5-2:28 FileNode.node/kind elif
----

If your graph is small, it can be useful to display it graphically:

[source,bash]
----
echo '
{"source":{"corpus":"example","path":"hello"},
 "fact_name":"/kythe/node/kind","fact_value":"ZmlsZQ=="}
{"source":{"corpus":"example","path":"hello"},
 "fact_name":"/kythe/text","fact_value":"SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ=="}
' | ./kythe-verify-json.sh -annotated_graphviz test.goals | xdot
----

This graph will render in https://github.com/jrfonseca/xdot.py[xdot.py] as
something like:

[kythe,dot,"one file node",0]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
digraph G {
"App(vname, (\"\", example, \"\", hello, \"\"))" [ label=<<TABLE><TR><TD COLSPAN="2">(&quot;&quot;, example, &quot;&quot;, hello, &quot;&quot;) = FileNode</TD></TR><TR><TD>/kythe/node/kind</TD><TD>file</TD></TR><TR><TD>/kythe/text</TD><TD>...</TD></TR></TABLE>> shape=plaintext  color=blue ];
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's only one node in this graph, but it's the file node that we asked the
verifier to find; notice how it is outlined in blue. The verifier applies this
highlighting to nodes that are matched against variables in the goals
(here, `FileNode`).

=== Testing for variable definitions and references

Most of the time, verifier rules are written down in the same file that the
rules are meant to check. For example, we can rewrite our example program
in the following way:

[source,lua]
----
--! @foo defines/binding VarFoo
--! VarFoo.node/kind variable
var foo = 1
--! @foo ref VarFoo
print foo
----

Let's start with the second line. To satisfy this goal, the verifier must find
the VName of a node with a `node/kind` fact with the value `variable`. It will
then use that VName wherever the variable `VarFoo` appears. `VarFoo` is
interpreted as a variable because it begins with a capital letter.

To satisfy the goal on the first line, the verifier must find two VNames:
one to substitute for `VarFoo` (the same `VarFoo` as previously discussed)
and one to use as the VName of the anchor spanning `foo` on the next
line of code. The `@foo` token generates a new VName variable and constrains
it to refer to an *anchor* node with the offsets of `foo`. Any additional
constraints on `@foo` act as constraints on that variable. In order for this
first goal to succeed, then, the verifier must find an anchor spanning the
text `foo` that is the source of a `defines/binding` edge with some other
node (with VName `VarFoo`) as a target.

Similarly, to satisfy the goal on the fourth line, the verifier must find
a `ref` edge starting at an anchor covering `foo` on the next line of code
and ending at a node with VName `VarFoo`.

NOTE: `@foo` does not refer to the same variable as the `@foo` on the first
line. Each `@` token creates a new anonymous variable.

The *full* problem that the verifier must solve is the *conjunction* of all
of these goals. If it chooses a VName to use for `VarFoo` that works for the
first goal but not the third, the verifier will backtrack and try a different
assignment. The test succeeds if there is an assignment that satisfies all
the goals. When our first example failed, the verifier couldn't find any
assignment to `FileNode` that would satisfy `FileNode.node/kind elif`.

Assuming we update the offsets in our output to reflect the comments
(these are now `(66, 69)` and `(100, 103)`), we can now check our code:

[source,bash]
----
./kythe-verify-json.sh --goal_prefix="--!" test.program < test.program.json
----

We can also dump our graph:

[source,bash]
----
./kythe-verify-json.sh --goal_prefix="--!" --annotated_graphviz \
    test.program < test.program.json | xdot
----

This results in the following:

[kythe,dot,"tiny program",0]
----
digraph G {
"App(vname, (\"\", example, \"\", hello, \"\"))" [ label=<<TABLE><TR><TD COLSPAN="2">(&quot;&quot;, example, &quot;&quot;, hello, &quot;&quot;)</TD></TR><TR><TD>/kythe/node/kind</TD><TD>file</TD></TR><TR><TD>/kythe/text</TD><TD>...</TD></TR></TABLE>> shape=plaintext ];
"App(vname, (foo#0, example, \"\", hello, ex))" [ label=<<TABLE><TR><TD COLSPAN="2">(foo#0, example, &quot;&quot;, hello, ex) = VarFoo</TD></TR><TR><TD>/kythe/node/kind</TD><TD>variable</TD></TR></TABLE>> shape=plaintext  color=blue ];
"App(vname, (@66:69, example, \"\", hello, ex))" [ shape=circle, label="@foo:1.4", color="blue" ];
"App(vname, (@66:69, example, \"\", hello, ex))" -> "App(vname, (foo#0, example, \"\", hello, ex))" [ label="/kythe/edge/defines/binding" ];
"App(vname, (@66:69, example, \"\", hello, ex))" -> "App(vname, (\"\", example, \"\", hello, \"\"))" [ label="/kythe/edge/childof" ];
"App(vname, (@100:103, example, \"\", hello, ex))" [ shape=circle, label="@foo:4.6", color="blue" ];
"App(vname, (@100:103, example, \"\", hello, ex))" -> "App(vname, (foo#0, example, \"\", hello, ex))" [ label="/kythe/edge/ref" ];
"App(vname, (@100:103, example, \"\", hello, ex))" -> "App(vname, (\"\", example, \"\", hello, \"\"))" [ label="/kythe/edge/childof" ];
}
----

As before, the nodes we've matched are colored blue. In these diagrams, anchors
are presented as circles with `@` labels (unless they are matched to verifier
variables, in which case more information is provided). The vast majority of
the time, you will not be interested in seeing file offsets in these diagrams.
You can still test for facts on `@`-specified nodes as you would any other
node.

For more examples of the goal language, take a look at the code listings in the
http://www.kythe.io/docs/schema[schema document]. There are also lots more in
the $$C++$$ indexer's
https://kythe.io/repo/kythe/cxx/indexer/cxx/testdata[testdata] and the Java
indexer's
https://kythe.io/repo/kythe/javatests/com/google/devtools/kythe/analyzers/java/testdata[testdata]
directories. Finally, there is a
http://www.kythe.io/docs/schema/verifierstyle.html[style guide] with helpful
tips.

Note how the verifier goals don't mention any of the internal implementation
decisions we've made about the VNames of anchors or variables. This means that
if we later choose to change those aspects of our implementation, the verifier
tests will not break. Also note that we didn't check for details about the
file itself (as we did in the first example). Tests using the Kythe verifier
rarely examine *all* of an indexer's output, just the subgraph that is relevant
for a particular feature. This makes the tests easier to read and guards against
tests becoming sensitive to new features.
