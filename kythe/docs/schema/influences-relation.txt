The `influences` relation
=========================

Kythe stores information about dataflow in the graph using
https://kythe.io/docs/schema/#influences[`influences`] edges. A node *A*
influences a node *B* if *A* directly affects *B* during the evaluation
of a program. This relationship is not intended to model all dataflow
interactions. In particular, it excludes nontrivial aliasing (that can't
be decided within the scope of a single compilation unit). Despite this,
the influence relation can be used to trace simple paths through a program
by exploring the subgraph iteratively, allowing for non-universal queries
that fit the following examples:

* find places where a flag passed to a program directly affects a different
  program value
* find places where the return value from a sensitive function is passed to an 
  insensitive sink, like leaking a key to a logging function
* identify the places that affect a program value that was assigned something
  unexpected at runtime

This document is intended to describe how to add the `influences` relationship
to a Kythe indexer based on common language features. Note that this document
is still under active development.

== General framework

We assume that the indexer being amended performs an AST walk over a tree
with resolved references (so it's possible to construct VNames for, e.g.,
a variable that is referenced). The indexer should maintain a stack of
sets of influencers (using whichever type is appopriate; for C++, we use
pointers to declarations). As the indexer enters and leaves various kinds of
AST node and encounters others, it will manipulate this stack.

Names follow this convention:

* `v` is a simple program variable.
* `p` is a parameter.
* `e` is an expression.

Popping the set "onto" an object `o` with node `n` means removing the top
set from the influencers stack and recording `i influences n` edges for all
nodes `i` for the objects in that top set.

The *blame context* is the node or nodes that would be assigned responsibility
for making a function call at the current point in the AST. For example:

  int f() { g(); }

Here, the call to `g` would be assigned to blame context `f`.

== Variables

=== Simple reference

  v

* Insert `v`.

=== Simple assignment

  v := e

* Push `{}`.
* Traverse `e`.
* Pop onto `v`.

void f() {
  //- @x defines/binding VarX
  int x = 0;
  //- @y defines/binding VarY
  int y = 1;
  //- // VarX influences VarY
  y = x;
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Functions

=== Simple calls

  e(e1 ... eN)

* Traverse `e`.
* For each of `e1 ... eN` with corresponding parameters `p1 ... pN`:
  * Push `{}`.
  * Traverse `eI`.
  * Pop onto `pI`.
* Insert `e`.

=== Returns

  return e;

* Push `{}`.
* Traverse `e`.
* Pop onto the blame context.

}

void f() {
  //- @y defines/binding VarY
  int y = 0;
  //- @z defines/binding VarZ
  int z;
  //- VarY influences ParamX
  //- FnG influences VarZ
  z = y + g(y);
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Forward declarations

  f'(p'1 ... p'N);
  f(p1 ... pN) { ... }

* `p'I` influences `pI`.
* `f` influences `f'`.

//- @y defines/binding DefnParamY

  return x + y;
}

//- DefnFnF influences FwdFnF
